# AI Greenhouse
Ongoing project building & improving an automated greenhouse.
Now capable of watering, cooling and monitoring.

# Vision
In the end the greenhouse will be able to communicate with a webserver through an API.
The webserver will make calculations based on the sensors, weather information & specific plant information.
This will be fed back to the arduino, to improve the growth of the plants during the next period of time.

# Hardware
- IKEA Socker greenhouse
- Arduino Yun
- 12v PC Fan
- DHT11
- LDR sensor
- USB to 2.1mm DC Booster cable 12V
- Water pump 12v 
- Silicon waterhose 5x7mm
- Solar panel - 6V 3.5W
- Voltaic V44 Powerbank 12000 mAh
- 3.5x1.1mm to 5.5x2.1mm plug adapter for voltaic solar panel
- Variety of cables
- Small breadboard
- Water bottle

# Gear
- Standard multimeter(measures current and voltage with 2 probes, also measures temperature and could be connected to a computer using usb)
- Bakeey UM25C USB2.0 Color LCD Display Type C Voltage Current Cable Resistance Measure Tester (Hope you did not try to pronounce the whole sentence. If so, don't forget to breathe.)
- Screwdrivers
- Laptop used to type this..and for programming the arduino.

Coconut Coir

# Internet of things
Played around with https://dweetpro.io/ , https://temboo.com/ and eventually sticked with https://io.adafruit.com
Easy to setup with the arduino yun, good looking ui, clear tutorials, free tier plan and affordable to me in the future if I need more.

I setup https://io.adafruit.com and started to add the temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, led lights on/off indicator and waterpump. Actually I got stuck after the sensors and the led indicator, adding remote control took me more time to figure out. The Adafruit IO platform offers a good looking personalizable dashboard to show gauges, graphs, indicators and even clickable buttons for remote control of your iot connected device.

The cool thing for me is that the vision starts to become a reality with some bonusses.
I can now see the status of my self sustaining greenhouse from anywhere in the world :D 
Soon I can even decide to bless my plants with a splinkle of water while clearing my mind on the beach of any sunny island!


# Artificial intelligence 
( If's en else's based on certain sensor patterns and best practices..)

Soon more!
