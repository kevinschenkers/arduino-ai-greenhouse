# AI Greenhouse
Ongoing project building & improving an automated greenhouse.
Now capable of watering, cooling and monitoring.

# Vision
In the end the greenhouse will be able to communicate with a webserver through an API.
The webserver will make calculations based on the sensors, weather information & specific plant information.
This will be fed back to the arduino, to improve the growth of the plants during the next period of time.
